Hackathon Starter 
=======================

**NOTE** Hackathon-starter is primarily distributed using `git clone` of its repo at https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter. This npm package consists of a script that does that for you.  Alternatively you can go to the hackathon-starter repo and follow the installation instructions there.

Hackathon Starter is a boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

This npm package can be installed globally, and consists of a script that does the cloning of the hackathon-starter project for you.  

Install this npm package by installing it globally using:

If you get a permission error during the installation, retry with `sudo` permission in bash.  If you are using Windows CMD, retry using a CMD with Administrator privileges:
